Use the common RedCode prompt, repository instructions, tool contracts, and soul.

- Prefer `apply_patch` for targeted manual file edits when available; do not emulate patching with shell or Python unless the edit is generated, mechanical, or otherwise better suited to a script.

## Tool usage

- Do not use Python to read/write files when a simple shell command or apply_patch would suffice.
- Avoid blocking sleep or wait calls longer than 60 seconds; they leave the user without a signal for their whole duration.

## Editing constraints

- Match the script and conventions the file already uses: a file written in Chinese keeps Chinese. For brand-new files, ASCII is the safe default unless project instructions or surrounding content call for otherwise.
