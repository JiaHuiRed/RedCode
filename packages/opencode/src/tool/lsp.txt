Interact with Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers to get code intelligence features.

Supported operations:
- goToDefinition: Find where a symbol is defined
- findReferences: Find all references to a symbol
- hover: Get hover information (documentation, type info) for a symbol
- documentSymbol: Get all symbols (functions, classes, variables) in a document
- workspaceSymbol: List project-wide symbols matching a query string
- goToImplementation: Find implementations of an interface or abstract method
- prepareCallHierarchy: Get call hierarchy item at a position (functions/methods)
- incomingCalls: Find all functions/methods that call the function at a position
- outgoingCalls: Find all functions/methods called by the function at a position
- rename: Rename a symbol across the entire project. Requires newName parameter.
- codeAction: Get available code actions (quick fixes, refactors) at a position
- completion: Get completion items (suggestions) at a position

All operations require:
- filePath: The file to operate on
- line: The line number (1-based, as shown in editors)
- character: The character offset (1-based, as shown in editors)

workspaceSymbol also accepts:
- query: A query string to filter symbols by. Empty string requests all symbols.

rename also accepts:
- newName: The new name for the symbol being renamed.

For workspaceSymbol, filePath is not sent in the LSP workspace/symbol request. It is used by opencode to select and start the matching LSP server.

Note: LSP servers must be configured for the file type. If no server is available, an error will be returned.
